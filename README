To train the classifier, run:

pypy perceptron.py train.dat featlist.dat gaz.dat x test.dat > weights.dat

train.dat    - the training data file is a tab-separated file in this format:

de_word	de_pos	de_tag

featlist.dat - the feature list file is a list of preextracted features from
               the training data.

gaz.dat      - file containing german/english words from the gazetteer

x            - number of iterations you want to run

test.dat     - the test data file in a tab-separated file in the same format as the
               training data

weights.dat  - output file containing the feature names and feature weights, space-separated,
               from every iteration. Feature weights from different iterations are separated
               by a blank line.

To run the decoder:

pypy decode.py test.dat weights.dat gaz.dat
